        <div class="project-description">
            <p>Renewal Parking App is a real-time parking management tool built specifically for a church, designed to help track and organize parked cars without the complexity of a typical application. It uses Firebase to store and sync live data, such as which cars are currently parked, each parking slot’s status (available, occupied, ticketed), and the total number of spots. Users can easily add or remove cars, update statuses, and search for specific car numbers—all in a clean, mobile-friendly interface.

            I created this app with the goal of helping the church grow by providing a simple, intuitive tool that anyone could use, no tech expertise required. It went through three major versions, each reflecting what I’d learned at the time. As I gained more experience, I improved the interface, added real-time syncing, and included user-friendly features like an undo button. Through this process, I learned a lot about building with Firebase, designing for ease of use, and creating software that genuinely supports a community.</p>
