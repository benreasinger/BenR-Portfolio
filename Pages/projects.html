        <div class="project-description">
            <p>Renewal Parking App is a real-time parking management tool built specifically for a church, designed to help track and organize parked cars without the complexity of a typical application. It uses Firebase to store and sync live data, such as which cars are currently parked, each parking slot’s status (available, occupied, ticketed), and the total number of spots. Users can easily add or remove cars, update statuses, and search for specific car numbers—all in a clean, mobile-friendly interface.

The Renewal Parking App is a real-time parking management tool built for a church in a high-need area of Indianapolis, specifically to support their annual Christmas Store event. Their old system was paper-based and chaotic, so I created this app to bring structure, speed, and clarity.<br><br>

This was my first large-scale, hands-on project. I worked directly with the church leadership—my stakeholders—using real user stories, sprint feedback, and iterative design to build something that truly fit their needs.

The app, now on version 3.4, runs on Firebase and allows volunteers to track cars, update statuses, and manage parking in a clean, mobile-friendly interface. It’s not used daily, but during the Christmas Store event, it becomes essential—bringing real impact to a meaningful cause and teaching me how to build simple, community-focused software.            <p><b>Coding Languages:</b> HTML, JavaScript, CSS </p>
